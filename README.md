## Code style formatter file for STM32CubeIDE


### Status

It is not necessarily correct, but I will polish it once I came across something which annoys meg.

PRs warmly welcome!

### Why?

STM32CubeIDE generated code style differs from all the offered formatters and ST did not included a proper formatter file.
